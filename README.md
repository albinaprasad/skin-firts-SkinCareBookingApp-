🧴 Skin Firts – Skin Care Doctor Booking App

Skin Firts is an Android application that allows patients to easily book appointments with skincare specialists. The app provides a smooth, intuitive platform for users to browse available doctors, schedule consultations, view their booking history, and manage personal profiles — all within a clean, user-friendly interface.

Developed using Kotlin and XML, Skin First follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for scalable, maintainable, and testable code. Firebase Firestore is used as the backend database to handle real-time storage and retrieval of user profiles, doctor details, and appointment information.
